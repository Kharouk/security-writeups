# # Javascript - Source
Same ordeal as Authentication. Visiting the [website](http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-client/ch1/ch1.html) has an alert pop up asking for the password. You donâ€™t know it yet. Once you cancel and *fail* the first time, check the source of the page. There, you will find another javascript file with code that checks to see if the password matches with the flag.

#### Flag
`123456azerty`
