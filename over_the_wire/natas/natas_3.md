- Visit the elegantly looking page. Page source looks like they corrected the pixel incident. They’re *very* embarrassed.

- Usually that’s identified within a `robots.txt`, telling any kind of program to disallow checking a certain path.
- Certainly enough, visiting the `/robots.txt` page shows what they are trying to disallow. A `/s3cr3t/` path.
